### Codewars is a great place to develop your skills and get new knowledge

First, try to solve the kata yourself :wink: <br />
If some solutions helps you, please leave a star <br />

Kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving.

Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process. Every new Codewarrior (user) on Codewars starts being ranked as 8 Kyu.

What are Kyu and Dan? The terms are borrowed from a system in Japanese martial arts, which is in turn borrowed from the game of Go. Kyu indicates the number of degrees away from master level (Dan).
